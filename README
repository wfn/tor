### old wfn's tor fork

For my own memory lane of small nibbles on little-t-tor (core daemon); for posterity I guess; in particular, small branches from what I recall:
 - https://github.com/wfn/tor/tree/bug_9957_2
 - https://github.com/wfn/tor/tree/bug11648_dirserv_log_bogus_desc
 - old interesting zlib stream issue https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/issues/11648
 - maybe other stuff

### below follows original README

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

        ./configure && make && make install
